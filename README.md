Had my first nightmare trying to remember why i could not get the Logo and Nav to line up without me using Margins. Then after googling and referring to my notes i realised there was no , 

I have chopped and changed my font and probably will once i add more to my website, as i want the text to reflect on the kind of site this is.

added hero image, it is visible to see but as soon as i add no repeat as it comes up twice it dissapears also with attempting to center the image it dissapears

Just had a nasty reminder why to constantly commit and push to git. 2 hours of work.
finally got back to where i need to be. Struggling with adding my next image. But as it is a clear point i am moving on.

just remembered to add the class as active to the different pages.

Added the photos and checked they work, they do. So now i am playing around to see what will suit the page best in terms of shape. I have been consistent with the colour scheme and keeping the page look clean.

Added the photos to the zone page. Looks amazing as the theme has been so consistent. Unsure on how many to have in a column tried 2,3,4. Need second opinion

Cannot get the timetable image to work. It somehow keeps dropping below the footer and i cannot change the size.
