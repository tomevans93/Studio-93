Had my first nightmare trying to remember why i could not get the Logo and Nav to line up without me using Margins. Then after googling and referring to my notes i realised there was no , 

I have chopped and changed my font and probably will once i add more to my website, as i want the text to reflect on the kind of site this is.

added hero image, it is visible to see but as soon as i add no repeat as it comes up twice it dissapears also with attempting to center the image it dissapears

Just had a nasty reminder why to constantly commit and push to git. 2 hours of work.
finally got back to where i need to be. Struggling with adding my next image. But as it is a clear point i am moving on.
