Reasons why?

Home: The reasons for the main white background with the wallpaper is to bring a sense of calm. Keeping the colours and wallpaper consistent also brings the pages together. With the colour pallete I have gone for white/off white tones, with the aim of everything to look calm, clean and unclustered.
The font I have gone for is clear. The font is also very easy to read, when used as a heading it looks brilliant as the spacing between letters gives it real emphasis.
The hero image, reason for this is that straight away you get the image of peace, relaxation and tranquility. 
The list of different classes, people often know the names of the classes. But they do not know the true extent of how these classes benefit yourself mentally and physically.
The Home page i think is key to have the timetable so they can see when is good for them. But i am also going to display a small image on the join up page so if they forget they dont need to redirect to the home page. 

The Zone: This page is so the customers can see the surroundings that they will be transforming in. With the colour theme being so consistent they will feel at ease due to the calming nature. The formatting of the photos is structured to appear not so organised and more organic. This format I believe suits this page, as the next photo is slightly revealed on each photo resuliting in the constant scrolling.

CODE
I have been reffering to notes I made throughout the course. I have been using my edits on these to whatever is suitable and flows with my Website. 
When struggling with codes not working, I have used Youtube and https://www.w3schools.com/ it doesnt have the specific answer but it seems to have something along the lines. 

/* Comments as they happen */

Had my first nightmare trying to remember why i could not get the Logo and Nav to line up without me using Margins. Then after googling and referring to my notes i realised there was no (,) 
I have chopped and changed my font and probably will once i add more to my website, as i want the text to reflect on the kind of site this is.
Finally added the hero image, it is visible to see but as soon as i add no repeat as it comes up twice it dissapears also with attempting to center the image it dissapears
Just had a nasty reminder why to constantly commit and push to git. 2 hours of work.
finally got back to where i need to be. Struggling with adding my next image. But as it is a clear point i am moving on.
Just remembered to add the class as active to the different pages. 
Added the photos and checked they work, they do. So now i am playing around to see what will suit the page best in terms of shape. I have been consistent with the colour scheme and keeping the page look clean.
Added the photos to the zone page. Looks amazing as the theme has been so consistent. Unsure on how many to have in a column tried 2,3,4. Need second opinion
Cannot get the timetable image to work. It somehow keeps dropping below the footer and i cannot change the size. 
I could not figure out how to create the gap between the Class & Benefit below. After digging around and lots of trial and error, i remembered the suitable code was <hr> to then add addition to this but keep the thickness of 2px consistnent with the rest of the border lines being made.
Gitpod ran out of time on a Sunday, so cant fix anything.
Timetable image dropping below the footer - 
(Just watched Anna's video realised I have missed adding the codes when trying to fix them)
